# Giphy
Link to  Game: https://minalkarani.github.io/Giphy-Assignment/


Instructions:

When the user clicks on a Animal name button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops animating.

With every gif, its rating (PG, G, so on) and title is displayed.
  
Input box takes the value from a user and adds it into `topics` array.
